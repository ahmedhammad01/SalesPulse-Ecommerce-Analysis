## 4. Top 3 Things I Learned
1.  **Better Pricing**: I fixed the prices to match real-world shopping habits. Now the average order value is ~$246, which makes much more sense.
2.  **High Sales Volume**: The business is doing great, with almost 100,000 successful orders.
3.  **Top Products**: Just a small number of products (3%) make most of the money. 

## 5. My Advice for the Business
- **Stock Up**: Keep more of the "Top 10" products in the warehouse so they never run out.
- **Better Ads**: Most people buy cheap items. We should try to sell more "middle-priced" items to increase total sales.
- **Target Best Areas**: Focus our marketing on the cities and regions that are already buying the most.
